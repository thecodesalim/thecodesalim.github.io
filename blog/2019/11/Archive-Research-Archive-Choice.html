        <h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>A brief was given to me in my Research and Communication class, the brief requires me to explore an archive. The exploration is to understand how archive can be use to to yield material for use in research, through analysis, observation and wide variety of recording.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>This brief allows me to be flexible on what I want to research on. The research could be an interest or anything I can find my hands on. My first idea was to find a trainers archive. I love trainers it will be an opportunity to learn more about them and appreciate them more. I couldn‚Äôt find one in London. The only option was the Adidas shoe archive located in Germany. I had to drop this idea and find a new one.</p>

<p>My second choice was any archive I could find relating to the Bauhaus design movement, Bauhaus was a design school in Germany founded by Walter Gropius. The school eventually morphed into its modern art movement characterised by its unique approach to architecture and design (Richman-Abdou, 2017). My choice for Bauhaus stems from my interest in their work and finding new insights into their work. I found one on the V&amp;A archive website. I contacted V&amp;A and booked an appointment to view the Thought &amp; Idea - Bauhaus archive (See Fig. 1).</p>

<p>Fig. 1 Booking Appointment</p>

<p>Before going to view the archive I had no prior knowledge about the archive, not even the owner, all I knew about the archive is it relates to Bauhaus design school. I decided to use this method to avoid any preconceived idea when observing the materials.</p>

<h2 id="archive">Archive</h2>

<p>The archive contained articles and notes about Bauhaus. I looked through each one carefully analysing and taking notes about them. The first material from the archive is a paper with pictures of the Bauhaus teachers(see Fig. 2) and some of their works which were quite interesting but after that. The rest of the archival materials where newspaper, prints and magazine cuts(see fig. 3) talking about Bauhaus works their exhibitions, school, teachers, etc. I quickly realised I can‚Äôt work with this archive to produce meaningful content.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ac_3.jpg" alt="Prints" /></p>

<p>Fig. 3 Prints</p>

<p>The reason I was not able to create something from this archive is that the content of the archive are not related they are prints, magazines, texts, etc. There is no meaningful correlation to the contents, it was a mix and match contents.</p>

<p>I went back to check the archive details to understand why it exists and who owns it. The archive was owned by Hans Schleger an influential graphic designer from Germany, who did several commissioned work for London transport, helped modernised the London bus logo and several notable works(Black, 2012). The archive materials in this archive were very large it contained collections of articles, notes and press cuttings around various themes, used as research for Schleger‚Äôs work, and notes, correspondence and reference materials for specific projects.</p>

<p>While going through the archive page on V&amp;As website I saw they had in store posters Hans Schleger designed for London Underground from 1936-1947. I decided to give it a try and see since this one has the same type of content in it.</p>

<p>I went back to staff and asked for the posters designed by Hans for London Underground, she went into the room and came back out and said they are many I should pick the ones I want to see, immediately it came to my head to pick one from each year. After a few minutes, she came back with posters, upon viewing the posters a bulb came up in my head I was like I can surely work with this material. I went through them and snapped them on my phone so that I can take home and look at them more and create something meaningful out of them.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The process of finding an archive is quite long because it involves different steps. Which also add an interesting touch to the whole process knowing you are limited. I realised archive research is an activity that requires patience. You may not find exactly what you were looking for, but you may also find much more than you expected.</p>

<p>Finally, I feel like I should have done the research, read some published work before viewing the archive. It would have put me in a better position because I would have had a piece of background knowledge about what I‚Äôm viewing. It would have also saved my time and eliminated the back and forth I went through with the archivist.</p>
