        <h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>Think about ways that you can ‘spread the love’ in the community by making people happy to spend time helping their neighbours. The task is for the social services division of Epsom and Ewell council, they are trying to save money by getting the community to help each other.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>The challenge is a group work, we were 3 in our group. The first thing we did as a group was to search for the Epsom and Ewell services division and see what they do.</p>

<p>After that, we had to understand what “spread the love” means to have a clear vision of what we should do for the community. “spread the love” is about helping others. The good thing about helping others is it makes you happy and creates safety for you (Marie Hartwell-Walker, 2020). This simple understanding of “spread the love” in the community gave us an idea on what to work with. The idea is helping is not only beneficial for them but also you.</p>

<p>We used this idea of “spread the love” to brainstorm as team and generate different ideas.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Story Time</li>
  <li>Physical Activitives e.g dancing, hiking</li>
  <li>Coding</li>
</ol>

<p>The one idea that remained after scrutiny is the one to teach kids how to code, the programme is mainly for kids but old people can also join in the fun. The idea is to bring kids together to learn how to develop their skills.</p>

<h2 id="developing-idea">Developing Idea</h2>

<p>In this part, we take the idea and develop it into a practical idea that can benefit the community taking into consideration different factors.</p>

<h3 id="cost">Cost</h3>

<p>The University has a partnership with Epsom and Ewell Council which allows members of the community during the weekend to come to the university to learn and socialise. Our idea fits in perfectly when parents come they can drop their kids or join them to take part in the programme. This programme is not going to cost the council a dime. The University has computers available which the programme will use.</p>

<h3 id="target">Target</h3>

<p>The target group for this social service programme is for young kids and old people. Our program is designed mainly for young kids but also any other person can take the advantage to learn something useful.</p>

<h3 id="volunteering">Volunteering</h3>

<p>Why should people volunteer to teach people how to code?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Opportunity to learn new skills</li>
  <li>Gain real-world experience</li>
  <li>Be part of a community</li>
  <li>Boost your career</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>

<p>The goal is to equip people with coding and communicating skills. The syllabus will be designed with kids in mind. The syllabus will start from foundational basic up to where the participants can be able to apply their new skills to solve their own and community problem through coding or problem-solving. Other skills are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Logical Thinking</li>
  <li>Creativity</li>
  <li>Math Skills</li>
  <li>Problem-solving skills</li>
  <li>Innovation</li>
  <li>Computer Literacy</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ad-campaign">Ad Campaign</h3>

<p>As a way to promote the programme and make people attend we had to find a way to make kids come. When kids hear it is going to be about education, they might not be interested. We decided to build an Ad Campaign around making their dreams come true. The idea came from the LEGO 2017 ad campaign that encourages kids to build their future.</p>

<p>Using the tagline “create your dreams” flyers will be designed to tell the kids they will learn how to create their video games, apps and websites. Using this idea kid will be inspired to create their dreams and make them attend the programme.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, this challenge was engaging and fulfilling within a short period of time we were able to brainstorm and generate ideas. And also narrow the ideas into one and how can we possibly make it happen. Researching about the social services what they offer and how our idea will be different. Thinking about why people should volunteer and how to get kids to join.</p>

<p>Lastly, having done several challenges and briefs in group I feel now I tend to work better in a group by giving peer reviews and communicating better.</p>
