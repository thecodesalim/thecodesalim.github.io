        <h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>
<p>You are required to record and present your group impressions of a London Event visit (researched and negotiated prior to attendance. Design and design related events can be found in abundance in London and surrounding areas. After careful negotiation, discussion and agreed consensus, you will edit and assemble a 10-minute presentation.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>Following from my last <strong>post</strong>, I was tasked with researching and editing slides for our presentation about the challenges about why airline companies havenâ€™t switched to a sustainable replacement to plastics.</p>

<p>As a student the first thing I did was to open to <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a> and search for my query, that was the beginning of my research.  I went through several sites to gather my results.</p>

<h2 id="findings">Findings</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/plasticwaste.jpg" alt="Plastic Waste" /></p>

<p>Fig. 1 Plastic Waste</p>

<p>These are the findings from the research:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Low cost of producing plastics is the major reason(It is cheap)</li>
  <li>Plastics are lighter than the alternatives available(steel or ceramics) thus reducing fuel consumption</li>
  <li>Items need to be packaged to some extent and packaging alternative is more costly at this point</li>
  <li>There is currently no tested and used eco-friendly replacement for plastic</li>
  <li>It is easier for personnel to inspect items like blankets and headsets for signs of tampering</li>
  <li>Not all plastics are produced equal. Their likelihood of being replaced boils down to their resin identification code.(Tiny triangles with the number inside that indicates the type of plastic an item is made of)</li>
  <li>Most companies use it as a way to differentiate service between economy class to the expensive classes(Business and First class)</li>
  <li>It keeps collecting, washing and sanitising dish-ware to a minimum.(Saves cost for companies)</li>
</ol>

<p>The results from the research always comes back to the fact airline companies only care about saving cost and maximising profit.</p>
