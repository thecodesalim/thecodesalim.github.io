        <h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>A brief was given in my Research and Communication class at University to work in a group titled ‚ÄúFirst Cut‚Äù of visiting a design event in London researched and negotiated before attending. This was the first assignment given to be us to be done as a group.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-group">Finding a Group</h2>

<p>The problem is we were all new at the time the brief was given I was only talking to 2 other classmates of mine. The <strong>CHALLENGE</strong> was to get into a group of 3 or more and work on the assignment. At first, it was a daunting task for me, how am I going to get into a group?. Throughout the week I thought should I ask one of them if there are already in a group or lest create one. So during the next class during the break I went to meet one and asked her if she has a group, she was like yes do you want to join? I said yes as simple as that I got into a group.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 Discussion</p>

<p>That same day we agreed to meet at the library to discuss how we are going to approach the assignment(see Fig. 2). After the days‚Äô lesson, we all went to the library met up and discussed, research and negotiated together which London design event we are to going and how we were going to breakdown the assignment. We all sat down and started exchanging and floating ideas on how to go about with the assignment, I was shocked by the number of ideas floating around. We all had our strong points, Joko is good in taking initiative, Antonie is good in analysis, and the rest of us were good at creative thinking. Very captivating and intellectual ideas were being exchanged and being noted. One person was writing all the ideas being thrown during brainstorming stage. We as a collective decided to go to London Design museum because they were having an exhibition about plastic waste generated when traveling titled ‚Äú PriestmanGoode presents Get Onboard: Reduce. Reuse. Rethink ‚Äú it was an idea we all in the group relate, understand and a big problem in the world right now.</p>

<p>The exhibition was reiterated and explored deeper to see how we can utilise it. The main idea we had is to educate people about the amount of waste they generate per day without having a second thought about it. And also small action can make a big difference. We decided to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A short film documenting the waste we produced for the trip.</li>
  <li>Produce a stop motion video for the waste.</li>
  <li>A presentation.</li>
</ol>

<p>One member of the group suggested our presentation follows a method, the method involves splitting the presentation into introduction, research, challenge and solution. The tasks were shared depending on the person‚Äôs preference and skills.</p>
