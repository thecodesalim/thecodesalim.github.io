        <h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>Your challenge is to analyse, present and conclude a range and/or sample of information based on the data collated.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>After analysing the list and pictures provided, I created 3 groups made up of different categories. I tried to create a category in a way that each one tells a different story. Then I matched the picture that corresponds to that specific category. I then analysed an individual from within that picture to figure out if the individual was making an honest decision.</p>

<p>The individual I decided to analyse after reviewing the photographs was Joko. In the photographs she was wearing a black and white striped sweater with navy blue trousers and blackboots, which had some silver detailing.</p>

<h3 id="group-1">Group 1</h3>

<p>The first group which focuses on personality is made up of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leader/ Follower</li>
  <li>Confident/ Shy</li>
  <li>Introvert/ Extrovert</li>
  <li>Optimist/ Pessimist</li>
  <li>Passive/Aggressive</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first category which is Leader/Follower, Joko positions herself as a Leader in the photograph. From reading her body language I believe she is being honest. She is standing with a confident stance and a big smile on her face. She looks comfortable with her decision.</p>

<p>The second category which is Confident/Shy Joko places herself as a confident person. In the photograph she seems distracted, so it‚Äôs difficult to read her. Since she placed herself as a leader in the previous category I have strong reason to believe she is confident, because one of the characteristics of a leader is confidence.</p>

<p>The third category is Introvert/Extrovert and Joko positions herself as an introvert. She is standing relaxed with her hands in her pockets, she also has a big smile on her face. I think she is being honest because it‚Äôs possible to be a leader and confident while navigating the world as an introvert. Being an introvert does not mean one does not like people it means at some point one must break away to recharge because they do not like feeling drained.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 Personality</p>

<p>The fourth category is Optimist/Pessimist Joko places herself on the optimistic side. She is hardly visible in the photograph but I am able to recognize the top of her head. It is a complete possibility that Joko may or may not be a pessimist, but it is difficult for me to know because I cannot see her in the photograph. She may truly be an optimist because from all the photos I have analysed she seems like a positive person, that may also be due to the fact that she is being photographed.</p>

<p>The fifth is Passive/Aggressive and Joko claims to be a passive person. The photograph is not convincing me that Joko is a passive individual. She is standing with a slight slouch and one of her hand covering half of her face. In this photograph Joko seems unsure of herself. I also feel like since she considers herself to be a leader she should not be on the passive side she should be on the aggressive. Leaders are meant to be assertive and they are meant to take action not let things happen to them.</p>

<h3 id="group-2">Group 2</h3>

<p>The second group I created has a focus on beliefs and is made up of the following categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sex before marriage</li>
  <li>Religious Yes/No</li>
  <li>Conservative/ Liberal</li>
  <li>Pro life/ Pro Choice</li>
  <li>Death penalty Yes/ No</li>
</ol>

<p>The first category of the second group is Sex Before Marriage. Joko and also everyone else is ok with sex before marriage. Joko is standing straight up with her hands in her pockets. She is also cheesing to the maximum because her cheeks appear to be at their highest point. Joko appears to be relaxed and the huge smile on her face is telling me she is content with her choice.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vs_1.png" alt="Beliefs" /></p>

<p>Fig. 2 Beliefs</p>

<p>The second category of the second group is Religious and Joko places herself on the religious side. Majority of the class are on the non-religious side, so I do not believe Joko is trying to fit into the crowd. In the photograph Joko stands proudly while holding one side of the sign that says ‚ÄúYES!‚Äù.</p>

<p>The third category is Conservative/Liberal and Joko confidently places herself as a Liberal. Joko is standing tall, yet again with a big smile on her face. Our generation is open-minded and more willing to accept new opinions I believe. This gives me enough reason to believe Joko is truly liberal.</p>

<p>The fourth category is Pro Life/ Pro Choice and Joko and everyone else in the class are on the Pro Choice side. Her facial expression is the same as others in this photograph, she is looking right into the camera with a smile on her face. This shows me she is confident with her decision. Joko being a Liberal woman is enough for me to believe she is being honest with her choice.</p>

<p>The fifth and final category for this group is the Death Penalty and Joko is against the death penalty. In the picture Joko seems to be distracted, she has her back facing the camera. I really can not analyse her because she is distracted in the picture, so she is not readable.</p>

<h3 id="group-3">Group 3</h3>

<p>The third and final group I created focuses on Family and Relationships and is made up of the categories listed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family/Career</li>
  <li>Has children</li>
  <li>Want‚Äôs children</li>
  <li>Single/ Taken</li>
  <li>Faithful</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first category of the third group which is Family/Career, Joko picked her family over her career. She is standing with her hands in her pockets and one of her foot is kicked out in front of the other. She is looking straight into the camera with a huge smile on her face. She appears to be comfortable with her decision, she does not look unsure at all.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/vs_1.png" alt="Family" /></p>

<p>Fig. 3 Family</p>

<p>In the next category, Joko is on the side that have no children. All but one of the students have no children. This is no surprise because all of the students are still young. Most people wait till they are older and more stable in all aspects of their lives before they have kids. Some people want to be married first before they have kids. Joko may not have kids because of these reasons or also maybe because she also does not want to have kids at all.</p>

<p>The third category of the third group is Want‚Äôs Children. Joko‚Äôs facial expression is a smile but it is a bit flat. She seems unsure of her decision. I think maybe right now she does not want children but in the future it may be a possibility for her.</p>

<p>The fourth category is Single/Taken and Joko places herself on the taken side. She looks assertive in her stance and also has a huge smile on her face. She appears sure and confident in her choice that she is truly taken.</p>

<p>The fifth and final category of the third and final group is Faithful. Joko positions herself on the unfaithful side. This is a bit hard for me to believe because from analysing her previous decision she always seemed to be on the ‚Äúgood‚Äù side of things. She does seem to be confident in her decision in the picture, maybe it is not something necessarily bad to her.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>After examining Joko and her choices I have come to the conclusion that she is overall honest with the choices she has made. There were a few times when she did look unsure and she may have been. This process of reading people was interesting for me. After seeing people‚Äôs decision on a large scale I started to have a picture of who they really might be. Something I may not have known if I had not completed this assignment.</p>
