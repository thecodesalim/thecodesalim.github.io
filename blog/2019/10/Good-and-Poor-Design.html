        <h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>In my Research and Communication class, I was tasked with discussing 3 good and 3 poor designs  using the 10 Principles for Good Design by Dieter Rams.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>It is important to understand why good design is important. Design is a form of communication, communication is meant to be clear and easy to understand. The same applies to good design.</p>

<p>What is good design? That is where Dieter Rams takes control. Dieter Rams is a German Industrial Designer known for his ‚Äúless is better‚Äù philosophy which he used to design several products for Braun. He led and laid guidelines for the Functionalist design movement. Functionalist design is a design movement in which the form of the object is driven by the purpose of the object and not by its aesthetics only.</p>

<p>I started by examining the products around me that I use daily and compared them to the Good Design Principles. I created a list of the products and further drilled them down to the ones that interested me the most to expand upon(I think they are good examples).</p>

<p>Dieter Rams codified his learning experience as a Designer into a set of 10 collective principles.</p>

<h2 id="the-10-principles-for-good-design">The 10 Principles for Good Design</h2>

<p>According to Dieter Rams, good design:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Is innovative</li>
  <li>Makes a product useful</li>
  <li>Is aesthetic</li>
  <li>Makes a product understandable</li>
  <li>Is unobtrusive</li>
  <li>Is honest</li>
  <li>Is long lasting</li>
  <li>Is thorough down to the last detail</li>
  <li>Is environmentally friendly</li>
  <li>Is as little design as possible</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="good-design">Good Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Tote Bag</li>
</ol>

<p>Some people use the tote bag as an eco-friendly replacement for plastics when they go shopping or to store food in their pantries. Others wear it as a fashion accessory that meets and exceeds all expectations of comfort and aesthetics. The tote bag is now a universal symbol of functionality.</p>

<p>It ticks all the 10 Good Design Principles by Dieter Rams. A tote bag(see Fig. 1) design is simple and allows the user to use it in any way or form. The user can hold it, put on it on their shoulder or strap it around which makes unobtrusive.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Polaroid Camera</li>
</ol>

<p>Edwin Land invented the instant film in 1947. The Polaroid design(see Fig. 2) is an iconic design that is still being used in Point and Shoot Camera. The shutter button is so easy to handle a toddler can play with a polaroid camera. The only function is to shoot and print photos with few or none filter presets. The company is still producing camera‚Äôs with the initial design of the camera.</p>

<p>Using Dieter Rams Principle for Design, the Polaroid Camera design was innovative, the first of its kind. It is aesthetically  pleasing and easily strikes all the criteria.</p>

<p>This is one a lot of people fail to appreciate because of how it is everywhere. The ease and delight of squeezing ketchup out of plastic bottle compare to the glass bottle is hell.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Swiss Army Knife</li>
</ol>

<p>The Schweiser Officersmesser know as the Swiss Army Knife was designed for the Swiss Army by West &amp; Co in 1890. The Swiss Army knife was originally designed for an army but it continues to be used for various reasons by everyday people. What makes the Swiss army knife so great is its ability to contain multiple tools while remaining compact. This makes it easy for people to carry it around anywhere and put it to use when they see fit.</p>

<p>The Swiss Army Knife follows Dieter Rams‚Äô Principles for design. The Swiss Army Knife design is long-lasting, it continues to be utilised by people today. The Swiss Army Knife is also an extremely useful product, there are multiple variations of the tool combinations for the purpose of suiting individual users.</p>

<h2 id="poor-design">Poor Design</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Wall Switch</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I have this thing with switches where I don‚Äôt know when it is on or off. At the apartment I live in I have a wall switch (see Fig. 4). The wall switch has the switches for the Cooker, Laundry Machine, Fan and Oven. The big issue is you cannot tell which switch is for which appliance without actually switching it on.</p>

<p>As Dieter Rams listed in his design principles a design should be unobtrusive, it makes the product understandable but this wall switch fails miserably by those design principles. Most people will blame themselves saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how it works‚Äù. A good design should eliminate the need for that and should automatically inform the users what each switch does. This is a small wall switch imagine an auditorium having such, it would be a complete disaster.</p>

<p>They are two ways this problem can be fixed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Leaving the switch on the appliances</li>
  <li>
    <p>Labelling each switch</p>

    <p><img src="assets/wallswitch.jpg" alt="a wall switch" /></p>

    <p>Fig. 4 A Switch Wall</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Faucets with Handle</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Wherever I step into a public restroom and I see they have a faucet with a handle(see Fig. 5) I shrug. This is a personal pet peeve of mine. For example, someone takes a poo and wants to wash their hands they have to touch the handle, wash their hands and use the same hand to close the faucet, this makes no sense at all. The handle  gets dirtier with each use, it is a bacteria transfer station, a  total mess.</p>

<p><img src="assets/faucetsjpg.jpg" alt="a faucet" /></p>

<p>Fig. 5 A Faucet with Handle</p>

<p>This product is not designed thoroughly down to the last detail and lacks usefulness. And also what I do in this situation is leave the restroom or when I‚Äôm pressed I use tissue paper to move the handle which makes the product not environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>A simple solution to this product is using a faucet that uses a sensor (see Fig. 6).</p>

<p><img src="assets/faucetswithsensor.jpg" alt="a faucet" /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Snapchat</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Snapchat was a mobile phone app that started as an app that allows users to exchange photos that disappear. With time Snapchat kept adding features that made the app lose most of its user base.</p>

<p>These features they added include text messaging, phone calls, video calls and also building a gaming platform(see Fig 7) into the app. The term used for this, is called ‚Äúfeature creeping‚Äù. Feature creeping is the excessive ongoing expansion or addition of new features to a product, especially in computer software, video games and consumer and business electronics. These extra features go beyond the basic function of the product and can result in software bloat and over-complication, rather than simple design.</p>

<p>Good design makes a product understandable, Snapchat design is not that. A new user coming to use Snapchat will be overwhelmed by the features the app provides, which makes the application difficult to understand and use. The features in the app are too much for the user it makes it obtrusive of the user only wants to user Snapchat for snapchatting.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This exercise introduced me to the 10 Principles for Good Design and allowed me to use it to critically analyse products in terms of their design. The products on these write ups are items I use in my daily life. I leveraged this opportunity to understand their underlining design on why they look the way they do and their features. To understand a product, you need to go back to the past and read the history behind it. History tells you what shaped it what it is and the reason for it.</p>

<p>Lastly, a good or poor design depends on the users intuition. It is all subjective.</p>
