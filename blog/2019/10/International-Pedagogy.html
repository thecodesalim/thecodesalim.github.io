        <h2 id="brief">Brief</h2>

<p>International Pedagogy was the first challenge I was given in my Research and Communication class. The challenge is to edit and present to members of our new cohort with simple phrases and/or actions and information to teach them about what ‚Äúyou‚Äù think they need to know about where you are from. The presentation should not be seen from a tourist perspective but a personal perspective.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>The brief has a paragraph stating ‚Äúkey words and phrases, cultural considerations, etiquette and how to be streetwise‚Äù. I started my work by looking at the paragraph and listing all the possible ways I could go with my presentation. I picked each theme and made a list of what I could explore using that theme. I called my mum and asked her to tell me things only Nigerians can relate to. I texted my friends and asked them about it. And my personal experience.</p>

<h3 id="words-and-phrases">Words and Phrases</h3>

<p>Before I dive into this theme I need to give background knowledge about Nigerian Pidgin Language. Pidgin language is a language that has developed from a mixture of two languages. It is used as a way of communicating by people who do not speak each other‚Äôs languages (Pidgin, n.d). Nigerian Pidgin is an English based pidgin language spoken in every part of Nigeria, it is sort of a lingua franca in Nigeria. Nigerian Pidgin is used in informal conversations. Nigerian Pidgin is so popular Google Search has an interface for it and a lot of News outlets like BBC also do their news in the slang. An example of Nigerian Pidgin is ‚ÄúI Dey‚Äù which means ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alright‚Äù in English. The brief has a paragraph stating ‚Äúkey words and phrases, cultural considerations, etiquette and how to be streetwise‚Äù.</p>

<p>The most popular phrase in Nigerian Pidgin is ‚ÄúHow far?‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow far?‚Äù has different meanings depending on the context. In most contexts, it is a simple informal greeting that‚Äôs best used with people you know. It means ‚ÄúHow is everything‚Äù, if someone asks you ‚ÄúHow far?‚Äù in Nigeria they are not referring to your journey to meet them.</p>

<p>They are many other Nigerian Pidgins but I cannot go through of all of them because there is as many words or phrases as a dictionary.</p>

<h3 id="cultural-considerations">Cultural Considerations</h3>

<p>The northern part of Nigeria is heavily influenced by Islam. The cultural considerations follow mostly Islamic /Arab culture. Where women and women are separated in social activities unless they are siblings or married.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Wedding Fatiha [Daurin Aure]</p>

    <p>Wedding from where I come from is a whole week event starting with a wedding Fatiha(Islamic marriage) and ending with the main wedding reception.</p>

    <p>Here are the lists of events that take place in order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Kayan Lefe
        <ul>
          <li>The grooms‚Äô side of the family shop for the bride. The items include but are not limited to shoes, bags, clothes, underwear, perfumes, cash, etc</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Wedding Fatiha [Daurin Aure]
        <ul>
          <li>This is the most significant part of the wedding. A religious priest is invited to make the wedding official. The event takes place at the mosque or brides house with guests invited. As opposed to what obtains in many other cultures, in the Hausa culture it is a representative from the groom and bride‚Äôs family usually does the exchange of vows and not the bride and groom.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Wuni [Sa lalle]
        <ul>
          <li>This is event is strictly for ladies, the brides family, friends and the grooms family. The event takes place in the brides family home. A mixture of traditional henna is made and used to make beautiful designs on the brides‚Äô palms, hands and feet. Friends and families get henna designs on their bodies also.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Kamun Amariya
        <ul>
          <li>It is a playful event where the grooms family goes to the brides family home to convince and negotiate with them to allow them to take their daughter, thus making her part of the grooms family.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Kai Amariya
        <ul>
          <li>This is where family and friends escort the bride to her matrimonial home, to be well received by the groom‚Äôs family. It is followed by prayers and advice from family and friends. It ends with entertainment, food and music for the family and guest.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="etiquette">Etiquette</h3>

<p>Nigerian etiquette is different from western etiquette, some westerners might call it absurd. To compile the list for my presentation I had to research.</p>

<p>Here is the list:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Physical/Body Contact</p>

    <p>In this part of the world called Nigeria physical contact is seen as a very normal activity, for example when someone is trying to call your name, get your attention or simply when having a conversation they can touch you. To outsiders, they‚Äôll find this odd because of the invasion of personal space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greeting</p>

    <p>Exchange of greeting cannot be rushed, it is seen as rude behaviour. You must take the time to ask about the person‚Äôs health, the health of their family, or other social niceties. That sounds quite normal but the problem is if you see the same person the next day you have to do it all over again. Also when greeting someone much older, it is a sign of respect and deference to bow the head.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Age</p>

    <p>Old age in Nigeria is an accomplishment. Old people are given utmost respect and cannot be disrespected in any way even if they are wrong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Left Hand is a Taboo</p>

    <p>Avoid greeting, giving or receiving objects or handling money or food with your left hand. It is seen as disrespectful and disgusting to greet, eat, handover or collect things from others with a left hand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Time</p>

    <p>There is a concept of time called ‚ÄúNigerian Time‚Äù which is a concept where things rarely start on time, appointments are not usually made, interruptions are frequent, and one can expect to wait for things to happen. When someone tells you an event is starting at 7 pm it means it‚Äôll start at 9 pm or 10 pm. And also it is a way of showing high standards by making the person wait.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>

<p>I titled my presentation ‚ÄúHow Far?‚Äù to draw the attention of my audience by telling them I‚Äôll explain the meaning of the title at the end of the presentation. I did that to hold the listeners attention. For the presentation since none of my listeners are from where I come from, I tried to focus on the things that are completely normal in Nigeria but are absurd to people from not that part of the world. I re-edited my research and created a 5 minutes presentation, you can find <strong>here</strong>.</p>
