<p>In this post, I will share my design philosophy and how I wish to approach digital design problems in the future. This is from my experience in this space designing and developing digital products.</p>

<p>In my Software Engineering undergraduate degree filled mathematics and technical courses, I took a class called Development for Usability. The class was about learning the principles of usability and prototyping of digital produtcs. Usability is part of the broader term ‚Äúuser experience‚Äù and refers to the ease of access and/or use of a product or website(The Interaction Design Foundation, n.d.). I‚Äôm lucky to have taken the class because I was encouraged to approach problems with a creative mindset.</p>

<h2 id="design-principles">Design Principles</h2>

<p>These are the design principles I belive in and follow</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Put the user first</p>

    <p>Design is about solving problems, resist putting your preferences. Understand your users by observing or interviewing them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a Design System</p>

    <p>Design System will speed up work, saves time and promotes consistency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prototyping is your best friend</p>

    <p>It will help you find problems in your products or features lacking.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add personality to your work</p>

    <p>Every website, every app looks the same nowadays. Go on <a href="http://behance.com">behance.com</a> or <a href="dribbble.com">dribbble.com</a> all the digital design look the same with slight changes to the colour. Design should have personality and character like fashion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Follow the humane design guideline</p>

    <p>The humane design guideline is a resource that provides guidance for designing ethically humane digital products through patterns focused on user well-being. With the growth in mobile technology where time and attention is an increasingly scarce resource. Instead of making us better as humans. It is exploiting out phsycolosgical vulnerabilities.</p>

    <p>As designers, we play a vital role in that space. It is our duty to build products that serve us not harm us.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do what makes you happy</p>

    <p>Solve problems that inspire you, find challenges you want to beat.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="design-principles">Exhibition</h2>

<p>I wanted to design a digital exhibition that can be experienced through screens. Thankfully I have been reading up and experimenting with generative art. "Generative art is art made using a predetermined system that often includes an element of chance (Tate, n.d.)."  The exhibition is to display art through screen. And simulate the feeling of being in a physical art exhibition by showing them in frames.</p>

<p>Using the power of randomness I built a program to generate primitive shapes with random height, width and radius and picking colours randomly from a colour palette.</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="default" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="thecodesalim" data-slug-hash="KKpKGqV" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="KKpKGqV">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/thecodesalim/pen/KKpKGqV">
  KKpKGqV</a> by Salim Abubakar (<a href="https://codepen.io/thecodesalim">@thecodesalim</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
<p>This exhibition is to show people computers can create art and it is exciting and fascinating to see what  it creates because it is unpredictable and not predefined. This opens door to what and how people think about art. My exhibition is tiny piece of what can be done in this space. </p>
